# BTModLauncherCacheTool
Tool for fixing RT cache, and any other mods that use Launcher/Git.

# How it works
The tool will scan your computer for a git portable extract (../git-core/git.exe) and your RogueTech Launcher settings XML. (This takes a while if you got large drives).

If tool reports errors, screenshot and file a ticket on RT discord. 

# Requirements
1. Download and extract portable git to anywhere. https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/
2. Download latest tool release. https://github.com/ceakay/BTModLauncherCacheTool/releases
